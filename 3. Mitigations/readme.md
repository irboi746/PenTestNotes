# Web Attack Mitigations
## XSS
## SQLi
## Session Hijacking
### Prevention for : 
1. Session Hijack with XSS Cookie Stealing
   * make cookies inacessible via Javascript 
2. Session Hijacking via Packet Sniffing
   * Using HTTPS
3. Session Fixation
   * generate a new session ID after every authenticated operation is performed i.e destroy and regenerate a new session upon successful login.
## Cross Site Request Forgery
* Tokens Captchas are also commonly used protection mechanisms. 
* Token must be a nonce to make part of the request required to perform a given action that is unpredictable by the attacker.
   * However the token will become useless if application is vulnerable to XSS.  
   * Therefore, one has to implement a random token for every request and be immune to XSS concurrently.
