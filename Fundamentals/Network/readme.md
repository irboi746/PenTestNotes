## What is DNS ?
* DNS (Domain Name System) is a distributed database arranged hierarchically with the purpose of providing an abtraction between Internet Services(WebApp, Email etc.) and IP Address.
* Thereby permitting : 
   * the use of names which are easier to remember instead of numbers to identify hosts(servers) 
   * the change of server IP address without the need to broadcast its IP address again by simply pointing the domain name to the new IP address. 
   * load balancing, where one name can refer to multiple hosts.
