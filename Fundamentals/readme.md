   ### HTTP Protocol
   * HTTP Protocol is a protocol for web browsing.
   * It uses a client-server protocol to transfer web pages or web application data. 
      1. The client will use a **web browser** to start a connection with a **web server**.  
      2. After connection is established, client will communicate with server via a **request**
      3. The server will then reply with a **reponse** and the content requested by the client. 

   ### HTTP Header
      * As mentioned above, there are in general two types of HTTP headers **REQUEST** and **RESPONSE**
      * Below will be the analysis of each of the respective headers.
