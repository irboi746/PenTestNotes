   ## Web Encoding
   * These are various common encoding method for web communication : 
      * [ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/)
      * [Unicode](https://unicode-table.com/en/#0032)
      * Base64
      * If not defined in the HTTP Header, the default encoding used will be the ISO-8859-1(Latin-1) 
   * HTML Entities
      * HTML language contains many characters with special meanings like "<>"
      * a string that starts with '&' or '&#' and ends with ';' is used so that the browser will not intepret these symbols as a HTML language element.
      * Although not intended as a security feature, HTML entities can help prevent many client side attacks like XSS.
   * [URL Encoding](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
      * URl sent over the internet must contain characters within the ASCII code set. 
      * Hence there are characters that cannot be represented over the URL and encoding is required. 
      * URLs use some characters for special purposes in defining their syntax, these are called reserved characters e.g : **! @ # $ % & * = + : / ? , ; : " )( ] \[**
      * When these characters are not used in their special role inside a URL, they need to be encoded. 
      * Again URL encode is not an intended security feature but it is able to help make the attack surface smaller. 
      
   ## HTTP Protocol
   * HTTP Protocol is a protocol for web browsing.
   * It uses a client-server protocol to transfer web pages or web application data. 
      1. The client will use a **web browser** to start a connection with a **web server**.  
      2. After connection is established, client will communicate with server via a **request**
      3. The server will then reply with a **reponse** and the content requested by the client. 
   ## HTTPS
   * HTTP is a clear-text protocol and by itself does not provide strong authentication between two communicating parties, therefore it can be easily intercepted or manipulated by an attacker.
   * HTTPS (HTTP Secure) or HTTP over TLS/SSl is a method where HTTP protocol is runned on a cryptographic protocol(TLS/SSL).
   * HTTPS protects the data exchanged between the client and the server.
   * HTTPS can secure the HTTP Protocol from basic passive packet sniffing, MiTM attacks as well as verify the web server through the digital certificates.
   * However, HTTPS does not protect against web application flaws like XSS and SQLi.
   * Additionally, there are attacks like SSL stripping, phishing websites, carefully crafted MiTM etc where attackers can also bypass HTTPS.

   ## HTTP Header
   * As mentioned above, there are in general two types of HTTP headers **REQUEST** and **RESPONSE**
   * Below will be the analysis of each of the respective headers.
   ### Request
   ![HTTP_Req](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/blob/main/Fundamentals/Resources/HTTPReq.JPG)
   #### "GET / HTTP/1.1"
   1. *GET* - is the default **request method**. There are other methods(VERBS) like POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE etc.  
   2. '/' - is the path of the file that is requested. In this case, "*/*" refers to the homepage. 
   3. *HTTP/1.1* - is the HTTP protocol version the browser wants to communicate in. It informs the server which version of HTTP to use in the communication 
    #### Host:(value) 
   * One Webserver instance(one IP address) can host multiple websites. **Host** header specifies the website that is to be requested.
   * Host value + Path will create the full URL  
   #### User-Agent:(value)
   * User-Agent reveals the browser version, operating system and language to the web server.
   #### Accept:(value) 
   * **Accept** header is used by browser to specify which document type is expected to be returned in the response.
   * In this case, a html is expected to be returned.   
   #### Accept-Encoding:(value) 
   * Similar to **Accept**, **Accept-Encoding** specifies the allowed content encoding to be returned in the reponse.  
   #### Connection:(value)
   * This header is to specify the connection type to the web server (closed/keep-alive) 
   * In this context, *keep-alive* indicates that the client would like to keep the connection open.
   * HTTP/2 or HTTP 2.0 does not have connection-specific header fields.
    
   ### Response
   ![HTTP_Res](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/blob/main/Fundamentals/Resources/HTTPRes.JPG)
   #### Status Line
   * This is the first line of a response message.
   * It contains the (Protocol Version) (Status Code) (Relative Textual Meaning of Status Code)
   * Hence in this case, HTTP1.1 is the protocol version used, 200 is the status code and OK.
   * Common Status Codes : 
       * 200 OK - Resource Found
       * 301 Moved Permanently - Requested Resource has been assigned to new permanent URI
       * 302 Found - Resource is temporarily under another URI
       * 403 Forbidden - Client does not have enough privileges and server refuses to fulfil the request
       * 404 Not Found - server cannot find the resource matching the request
       * 500 Internal Server Error - server does not support the functionality required to fulfil the request
       * More codes found [here](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)
   
   #### Date 
   represents the date and time at which the reponse message originated
   #### Cache-Control
   allows the client browser and server to agree about caching rules to save bandwidth.
   #### Content-Type
   lets the client know how to intepret the page content
   #### Content-Encoding
   tells the client the type of encoding used for the content
   #### Server
   This header displays the banner of the web server.
   #### Content-Length
   Indicates the length (in bytes) of the message.
