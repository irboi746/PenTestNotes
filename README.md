* These are notes for Pentesting and it is organised based on the methodology rather than technology. 
* Within each folder in Information Gathering, Footprinting and Scanning, Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation, there will be sub folders for Network Pentest, WebApp Pentest and System Pentest.
- [Fundamentals](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/Fundamentals)
   - [ ] Network
   - [x] [Web App](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/Fundamentals/WebApp)
   - [ ] System
* The methodology used is as such : 
   1. [Reconnaissance](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/1.%20Information%20Gathering)      
      - [ ] Network
      - [ ] Web App
      - [ ] System
   2. [Vulnerability Assessment](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/3.%20Vulnerability%20Assessment)
      - [ ] Network
      - [ ] Web App
      - [ ] System
   3. [Exploitation](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/4.%20Exploitation)
      - [ ] Network
      - [ ] Web App
      - [ ] System   
   4. [Reporting](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/5.%20Reporting)


* Pentesting is not about going from Steps 1 to 4 but rather, Steps 1 to 3 are to be seen as a loop and Step 4 is the last step.
