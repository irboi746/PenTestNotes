# PenTestNotes
![PenTest](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/blob/main/6.%20Resources/PenTest_Image.jpg)
* These are notes for Pentesting and it is organised based on the methodology rather than technology. 
* Within each folder in Information Gathering, Footprinting and Scanning, Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation, there will be sub folders for Network Pentest, WebApp Pentest and System Pentest.
* The methodology used is as such : 
   1. [Information Gathering](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/1.%20Information%20Gathering)
   2. [Footprinting & Scanning](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/2.%20Footprinting%26Scanning)
   3. [Vulnerability Assessment](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/3.%20Vulnerability%20Assessment)
   4. [Exploitation](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/4.%20Exploitation)
   5. [Reporting](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/5.%20Reporting)
* Pentesting is not about going from Steps 1 to 5 but rather, Steps 1 to 4 are to be seen as a loop and Step 5 is the last step.
