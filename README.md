# PenTestNotes (In Progress)
![PenTest](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/blob/main/5.%20Resources/PenTest_Image.jpg)
* These are notes for Pentesting and it is organised based on the methodology rather than technology. 
* Within each folder in Reconnaissance, Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation, there will be sub folders for Network Pentest, WebApp Pentest and System Pentest.
- [Fundamentals](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/Fundamentals)
   - [ ] Network
   - [x] [Web App](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/Fundamentals/WebApp)
   - [ ] System
* The methodology used is as such : 
   1. [Reconnaissance](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/1.%20Reconnaissance)      
      - [ ] Network
      - [x] [Web App](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/1.%20Reconnaissance/WebApp)
      - [ ] System
   2. [Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/2.%20Vulnerability%20Assessment%20%26%20Exploitation)
      - [ ] Network
      - [ ] [Web App](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/2.%20Vulnerability%20Assessment%20%26%20Exploitation/WebAttack)
      - [ ] System  
   3. [Reporting](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/tree/main/3.%20Reporting)


* Pentesting is not about going from Steps 1 to 3 but rather, Steps 1 and 2 are to be seen as a loop and Step 4 is the last step. 

## Phases in PenTest
* **Black Box Pentest** : Passive Recon Phase --> Active Recon (DNS Enum --> IP Netblock Enum --> (White Box Pentest))
* **White Box Pentest** : Live Host Enum --> Further DNS Enum --> OS Scanning --> Port Scanning --> Service Scanning --> Vulnerability Analysis --> Validation --> Exploit

Firstly, I would like to indicate that a lot of information was lifted from other websites and that content belongs to them (this is indicated on the pages).
I thank all the people that share cyber-security related information for free on the Internet, it's because of you guys I get to learn new tricks so conveniently and with low cost
