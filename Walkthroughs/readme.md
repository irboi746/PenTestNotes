# Relevant
 * [This](https://steflan-security.com/tryhackme-relevant-walkthrough/) walkthrough here shows that there are two ways to get to root, one through SMB vulnerability and another through uploading of a webshell which is also the same method as how the creator of the challenge TheMayor did it [here](https://medium.com/cybersecpadawan/relevant-walk-through-on-tryhackme-f7dedfcb00dc). 
* There are some learning points, here. 
   1) the use of threader3000 or any multi-threaded fast port scanning tool to scan for open ports
   2) to enumerate enumerate enumerate
 
# Internal
* There are many walkthroughs online and personally, I find [this](https://infosecwriteups.com/tryhackme-internal-writeup-480ce471efdd) and [this](
https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/TryHackMe-Internal) the best out there and there is no need for me to re-invent the wheel of writing walkthroughs
