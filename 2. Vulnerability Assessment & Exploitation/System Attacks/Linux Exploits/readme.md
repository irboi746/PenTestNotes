# Post-Exploit
* Idea of post exploitation is to gain more information, higher privileges, gain persistency and pivot if possible.
* Hence there are information that are required for the above to happen and they are the knowledge of System and Network.
* Below will be a cheatsheet of system and network information to gather.  
## System Information
|Goal| | |
|----|-|-|
|OS and Kernel|Environment Variables|Interesting Files|
|Users, Groups, Permissions and Privileges|Services and associated config files|Cron jobs and system tasks|
|installed applications and versions|running processes||

* Ultimate goal is to do privilege escalation
* Automated Tools to help

## Network Information
|Question to ask| | |
|---------------|-|-|
|How is the exploited Machine connected to the network|Is machine multi-homed? Is it possible to pivot?|Is there unfettered outbound connectivity to the internet or is it limited to certain ports. |
|Is there a firewall between this device and the other devices?|Is there any communication between this machine and the others?|What is the purpose of the communication and the current machine|
|what other protocols are being used in the machine|are there any machines initiating connection with the current host?|can traffic be intercepted?|

|Commands|Purpose |
|--------|--------|
|ifconfig -a |get information on current network interfaces|
|route|check for current network routes|
|traceroute -n <ip address>|check for how many hops between compromised machine and others|
|more /etc/resolv.conf|DNS information|
|arp -en|ARP cache to gain awareness about machine near us and communicating with us|
|netstat -auntp|machines connected, ports services connected, ports listening and establishment of connection|
|more /proc/net/tcp and more /proc/net/udp|same as netstat but if system is restricted|
|ss -twurp|same as netstat|  
|nmap -sT -p<abitrary ports> portquiz.net|check for outbound connectivity if there is internet connection and nmap can be transferred|
