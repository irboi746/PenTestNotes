## [Architecture Fundamentals](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/tree/main/System%20Security/Architecture%20Fundamentals)
This section is too long to be in this readme hence it is in the readme that is linked.

## Assemblers and Debuggers
### Assemblers
   * Assemblers are programs that translates Assembly language into machine code. 
   * Apart from translation of assembly code to machine code, the assembler also does further operations such as assigning memory location to variables and instructions as well as resolving symbolic names. 

### Popular Assemblers
   1. MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) 
   2. GAS (GNU Assembler)
   3. NASM (Netwide Assembler) 
   4. FASM (Flat Assembler)

### Assembling Process
   ![ASM_Proc](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/blob/main/images/SystemSec/image51.png)
   * When a source code file (ASM file) is assembled, the resulting file is called an object file. 
   * A linker is needed to create an actual executable as it takes one or more object files, libraries (e.g kernal32.dll, user32.dll) as seen above, and combines them to make an executable file.

### Compiler
   * Compiler is a program that converts high-level source code (C, C++, Java, C#) into a low level code/object file.
   * It will do the assembling and linking and therefore, the result is an executable.
   * Compilers are different from Assemblers.

## [Buffer Overflow & Shellcoding](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/tree/main/System%20Security/BufferOverflow%26Shellcode) 
This section is too long to be in this readme hence it is in the readme that is linked.
## Using Skeletons
* ***Skeletons*** is a "format" for conducting Buffer Overflow based on TryHackMe boxes namely "**Buffer Overflow Prep**" and "**Gatekeeper**". Refer to the [**README**](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/blob/main/System%20Security/skeletons/readme.md) file in the folder to find out more.   

## Cryptography and Password Cracking
* Encryption: process of transforming a message into a ciphertext
* Decryption: process of retrieving the original message from the ciphertext

### 4 Issues Cryptography aims to solve:
   1. Authentication
   2. Confidentiality
   3. Integrity
   4. Non-repudiation

### 2 types of Encryption:
   1. Symmetric Encryption : Sender and receiver uses the same key, examples are DES, AES, RC4, Blowfish, Caesar Cipher
   2. Asymmetric Encryption : Two keys for each peer, Public key: freely distributed, typically used for encryption and Private key: kept locally, usually used for decryption

### 2 Types of Algorithm
   1. Block Cipher : Data is handled in block e.g DES, AES
      * Two modes : 
        1. ECB (Electronic Cookbook)
          * Message is divided into blocks and each block is encrypted separately.
          * Ciphertext analysis is easier as identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks.
          * This is deprecated mode \
        ![ECB](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/blob/main/images/SystemSec/image33.png)
        2. CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) \
        ![CBC](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/blob/main/images/SystemSec/image3.png)
   2. Stream Cipher : Data is handled One byte at a time.

### Hash
* Algorithm that produces a fixed length block of bits from a variable length input message, for example MD5, SHA1 etc.
* Output is called hash/digest 
* 3 properties of hash : 
   1. Preimage resistance
   2. Second preimage resistance
   3. Collision resistance.
 
* Most hashes will have “avalanche effect” where one changed bit will cause a significant change in the output. 

### PKI, PGP, SSH & Cryptographic Attacks
* Sections will be added within the readme of [Cryptography and Password Cracking](https://github.com/irboi746/eCPPTv2-notes/tree/main/System%20Security/Cryptography&Password_Cracking)

## Malware
* Malware is the shortform for Malicious Software
* Malwares are softwares written to cause damage or infiltrate computer systems without the owner's consent.
