# Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation
## NETBIOS HACKING
* As we know, NetBIOS allows applications on different systems to communciate with one another over LAN. As such, there is a chance for it to reveal additional information such as computer names, usernames, domains, printers, available shares etc.
* checkout Fundamentals [NetBIOS 101](https://github.com/irboi746/PenTestNotes/blob/main/Fundamentals/Network/readme.md) for more basic knowdlege of netbios

### Tools 
1. net (Windows)
   * `net use <drive letter> <\\ip address\resource to connect to>`
      * used to connect or disconnect a computer from shared resource.
      * can be used to connect to remote shares that is not secured properly.
2. mount (Linux)
  * `sudo mount.cifs //<ip address>/<resource to connect to> /media/<name of mount point>/ user=,pass=`

## Null session
* Null sesion attacks relies on CIFS and SMB API to return information to an unauthenticated user.
* Malicious user can establish a connection to the Winddows system without provding any usernam and/or password.
* For it to work, connection must be established to the administrative share `IPC$`  
* This test command, `net use <\\ip address\IPC$> "" /u:""` can be used to identify if remote host is vulnerable to null session attack. 
* Afterwhich, further enumeration is to be done by other tools.
Tools : 
1. enum4linux
   * `enum4linux <ip address>`
   * Information gathered : 
     |Password Policy|Groups| | |
     |------|------|------|------|
     |target information|workgroup/domain|domain SID|OS info|
     |Printer Info|Users|Share Enumeration|Users SID|
     
2. rpcclient    
   * This is a tool that executes Microsoft RPC functions.
   * First we must establish a connection : `rpcclient -N -U "" <target IP address>`
   * useful commands afeter connection is established ï¼š
