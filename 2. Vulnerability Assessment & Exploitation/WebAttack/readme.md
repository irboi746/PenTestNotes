# Web Attacks

# Input Validation Attacks
* attack triggered by user input, where input subverts the anticipated function of an application because of insufficient validation on client or server side.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* where malicious scripts are injected browser side into otherwise benign and trusted websites.

### Goal of XSS
1. Cookie Stealing
2. Getting Complete Control over a Browser
3. Initiating Exploitation Phasse against Browser Plugins which will Lateral Move to the Machine
4. Keylogging

### Types of XSS
1. Reflected XSS
2. Stored XSS
3. DOM XSS
aaa \
Test 1 :
```
"><img src='aaa' onerror="alert('test')">
```
Test 2 : 
```
"><svg/onload="alert('test')">
```

### Finding XSS 
1. Blackbox
2. With Source Code
   * Look for all the points where application outputs data supplied by the user and tracking it back to the source where it is retrieved for the first time.

### Exploiting XSS


## SQL Injections (SQLi)
* a type of attack in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

### Finding SQLi
1. Find Injection Point
2. aaa

### Exploiting SQLi
#### In-Band SQLi
#### Error-based SQLi
#### Blind SQLi

#### Automated Tool (SQLMap)



# Session & Logic Attacks
## Session Hijacking & Fixation
1. Session Hijacking via XSS Cookie Stealing
2. Session Hijacking via wireshark
3. Session Hijacking via Access to Webserver
4. Session Fixation Attack

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Files and Resources Vulnerabilities
1. Local File Inclusion attacks
2. Remote File Inclusion attacks
3. Unrestricted File Upload
