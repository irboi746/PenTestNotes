# Reconnaissance
## Basics
### What is Recon
* Reconnaissance is the act of gathering information about the target and it is the very first and most critical step of every PenTest.
* There is no unnecessary information in information gathering and everything should be noted and could be useful in the future. 
* Recon is not a linear process but a cyclical process - Whole process repeats itself when a new subdomain, websites, projects are found.
* To make the cyclical process more organised, a mindmap tool like **freemind** is extremely useful for information gathering phase.
* Two aspects in Information Gathering : 
  1. **Business Info** : Mostly from Passive Recon 
  2. **Infrastructure Info** : Mostly from Active Recon 
* The objective of Reconnaissance in general is to obtain the information in the table below : \

### Active vs Passive Recon
1. Passive Recon
   * Information gathering without exposing presence
   * Examples of Information Gathered : 
      * Web Presence, Partners & Financial Information
      * Physical Plants as well as other Infrastructure related information that are publicly available.
2. Active Recon
   * Information gathering that interacts directly with the target system.
   * Fingerprinting and Vulnerability Scanning is done here
   * Examples of Information Gathered : 
      *  Ports, services, running systems
      *  Net blocks
      *  many more
