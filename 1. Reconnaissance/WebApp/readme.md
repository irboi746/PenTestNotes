# WebApp Recon
## Passive Recon
* The first step of Web information Gathering usually starts from electronic footprint of the target's websites, network and employees. As we know, these information can be gathered using passive recon methods.

### Tools of the trade : 
   1. WHOIS
      * used to look up domain ownership details from different databases
      * can be CLI or web-based (whois.domaintools.com)
      * typically runs on TCP port 43
      * Yield : 
         1. IP address of one of the machines of the organisation
         2. admin contact info
         3. technical contact info
   2. NSLOOKUP (DNS ENUMERATION)
      * DNS can be queried for IP addresses that we gathered from WHOIS database.
      * Remember RR types :
      
       | TYPE | Values and Meaning |
       |------|--------------------|
       |A|host IP address|
       |NS|an authoritative name server|
       |SOA| marks the start of a zone of authority|
       |CNAME|the canonical name for an alias|
       |MX|mail exchange|
       |PTR|Domain Name Pointer|
      
      * Command to run : `nslookup -querytype=ANY <domain name>`
      * a simple nslookip might reveal more IP addresses, where there will be a need to recursively query the IP address with WHOIS to find out the
