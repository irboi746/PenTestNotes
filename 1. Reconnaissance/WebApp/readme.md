# WebApp Recon
## Passive Recon
* The first step of Web information Gathering usually starts from electronic footprint of the target's websites, network and employees. As we know, these information can be gathered using passive recon methods.

### Tools of the trade : 
   1. WHOIS
      * used to look up domain ownership details from different databases
      * can be CLI or web-based (whois.domaintools.com)
      * typically runs on TCP port 43
      * Yield : 
         1. IP address of one of the machines of the organisation
         2. admin contact info
         3. technical contact info
   2. NSLOOKUP (DNS ENUMERATION) 
      * DNS can be queried for IP addresses that we gathered from WHOIS database.
      * Remember RR types :
      
       | TYPE | Values and Meaning |
       |------|--------------------|
       |A|host IP address|
       |NS|an authoritative name server|
       |SOA| marks the start of a zone of authority|
       |CNAME|the canonical name for an alias|
       |MX|mail exchange|
       |PTR|Domain Name Pointer|
      
      * Command to run : `nslookup -querytype=ANY <domain name>`
      * The above command will run a nslookup on any of the RR Types listed in the table above.
      * nslookup might reveal more IP addresses, where there will be a need to recursively query the IP address with WHOIS to find out more information about the target.  
      * Yield : IP address of domain, netblock as well as owner of netblock (recursive WHOIS query)
   3. Netcraft (www.netcraft.com)
      * One Stop Recursive DNS and WHOIS Enumeration 
      * Yield : IP address of domain as well as netblock and the owner of netblock
* **Aim of recursive WHOIS and NSLOOKUP is to uncover all IP addresses related to the domain or subdomain of the target.**
4. OSINT
      * Linkedin
      * Job Postings
      * Partners & Third Parties 
5. Google Hacking
6. Shodan
   
## Active Recon
* At this stage, we will be mounting scans and commands directly to the server and making our recon more visible.

### Fingerprint Webserver
* WebServer Fingerprinting can be useful not just for WebApp attack but also for attacking the OS (vulnerabilities based on OS version) hence information here might have overlap with OS attacks.
#### Tools of the Trade : 
1. netcat
2. httprint
3. whatweb
4. wappalyzer

##### Web Tools : 
1. Netcraft 
   * not useful if webapp is an internal server or there might be times where netcraft is unable to get the required information.
   * Yield : Web Server Version, IP addresses, Nameservers, Uptime Stats, IP address owner, Host Provider
