# Active Directory Enumeration
* There are two main attack flow for attacking Active Directory after a successful client side attack.
   1. Compromise a member of the Domain Admin to gain complete control of every single computer in the domain
   2. Compromise Domain Controller when we can then modify all domain-joined computers or execute applications on them.
* Therefore there are 4 information that needs to be enumerated for the above attack flow to be achieved
   1. Enumerate Domain Users and learn as much as we can about their group memberships
      * Powershell cript to do this 
   2. Unravel Nested Groups
      * Powershell cript to do this
   3. Find Logged in Users who are in High Value Targets(HVT) Group 
      * HVTs can be domain admin, or "potential avenues of chained compromise" which will lead to domain admin.
      * As credentials will be cached in memory, it is possible to steal credentials from these logged in HVT and authenticate with the stolen credentials
      
   4. Enumerate SPN (Service Principal Names)
      * when application like Exchange, SQL and IIS are integrated into AD, a unique service instance identifier (SPN) is created
      * enumerating all registered SPN will allow us to find out the IP address and port number of applications running on the servers integrated with AD.
      * Powershell script to do this
