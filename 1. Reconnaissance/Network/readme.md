# Network Recon
## Information Gathering 

#### Onilne Tools
1. DNS Dumpster    
   * Online tool to do DNS information gathering.
2. Foca & Shodan

#### Offline Tools
1. DNSEnum
   * A command line tools that get's host address, get name servers, get mx records, perform zone transfer queries, bruteforce subdomains
2. DNSmap
   * DNS enumeration bruteforce tool

## Scanning 
* Objective of Scanning is to map the network within the scope of engagement and find out the Port, Protocols and Services that are running on each host.

### Tools
1. HPING / NPInG
   * allow us to craft packets for host detection, porst scan and evade firewall.
2.  NMAP
   #### Standard NMAP Scan
   * **Half SYN Scan** `nmap -sS -p <port range> <ip address> 
   * **Full SYN Scan** `nmap -sT -p <port range> <ip address>`
   * **UDP Scan** `nmap -sU -p <port range> <ip address> `

   #### Stealth Methods
   * **Idle Scan** `nmap -Pn -sI <ip address zombie>:<open port on zombie> <ip address target> -v`
     * Pre-requisite  
        1. a zombie that assigns IP ID both incrementally and globally
        2. zombie that does not send or receive and packets so as to not disturb the IP ID.
     * How it works is [here](https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html)
   #### Stealth Operators
   * **Never do DNS resolution** `mnap <ip address> -n`
      * use whenever DNS resolution is not needed to keep more stealthy and reduce scan time. 
   * **FTP bounce scan** `mnap <ip address> -b`
      *  If FTP server is vulnerable, exploits FTP servers 'PORT' command to launch port scan from FTP server
      *  Detailed explanation [here](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-ftp-bounce-scan.html) 
      *  Scans using this method will appear on the network to have originated from FTP server.  
   * **NULL, FIN, Xmas Scans** `-sN, -sF, -sX`
      * Explotis the TCP RFC page 65 to differentiate open ports from closed ports.
      * Hence compliant systems will return a RST if port is closed and not respond when port is opened.
      * Details [here](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html) 
   #### Firewall  
   * **TCP ACK Scan** `nmap -sA <ip address>`
      * used to map the rulesets of firewalls and determine if the devices are both stateful and which ports are filtered.
